      "As I write this review the hotel is currently closed for restoration, so hopefully all the issues I am about to complain about will be rectified when they reopen in the second half of 2018.This is a very good hotel, and it is a famous hotel in Singapore so people will continue to visit wether the hotel is restored/updated or not. This is where the Singapore Sling was invented and they are delicious!The Tv's are old, the rooms are under-lit, the beds are unstable and creaky, the air conditioners are not reliable. The hotel is very tired.The staff is friendly, the man in the turban (there are a few) is always happy to take a picture with you and will be there to help you in and out of your car every-time.The Tiffin Room offers a lovely breakfast in the morning and very good Indian food later for dinner.The weekend brunch in Bar and Billiard room (YOU NEED RESERVATIONS) is out of this world with lobster, shrimp, oysters, an entire cheese and desert room and so many lovely stations including fresh pasta and carving stations. I LOVE brunch and this is a cant miss if you are a food ie in Singapore. The Long Bar is where you can find a lovely Singapore Sling.The Writers Bar is where you can sit, rest upon arrival etc.Hoping to see new updates of the hotel later this year and will definitely return!\n",

      "Although I have not stayed there recently I will never forget the experience of staying for a long weekend in this historic hotel. Service was exceptional - the staff even addressed us by name when we met them on the verandahs and always asked \"Are you enjoying your stay in our hotel?\". I could not understand initially how the staff knew that a guest had returned to the room and if a glass had been used it had been cleaned and returned to the room (I did work it out but I will not divulge their secret). I was also intrigued by the fact that a guest was never challenged when approaching the main staircase (access to upper floors is residents only) but visitors were stopped. Our room was supremely comfortable with teak floors, two comfortable double beds with luxurious bed linen, a dressing room and a bathroom. The breakfast buffet was amazing and each time a guest left the table to replenish their plate their linen napkin was carefully folded and placed over the arm of the chair. Raffles is one experience I would love to repeat.\n",

      "Anyone interested in the history of Singapore, architecture, wider British colonial history or alcoholic beverages, should visit the Raffles hotel. It is a fabulously ornate building in the heart of Singapore which reflects the mood of triumphalism in British colonial architecture at the time, whatever your view on the imperialist past, the building is a fabulous piece of history. The Raffles Bar is the alleged birthplace of the Singapore Sing which I of course had to indulge in, but at around £25.00 it was quite pricey, but worth it just for the experience! If you are in Singapore then make sure you visit the Raffles Hotel even if it is just to take in the fabulous architecture.\n",

This was not the case and parts of the hotel inc the Long Bar were closed.I was somewhat concerned that the Raffles atmosphere would be lacking. Not a bit of it. We stayed in Raffles back in 2015 and apart from parts being closed there was no discernible difference in what was on offer.A fabulous welcome on arrival and then shown to the East India Rooms where the reception was located at the ;time. No queueing but your are taken to a table and chairs and they come to you. A number of managers coming up and welcoming us to the hotel, almost to the point of slight embarrassment but cannot in any way knock it.Our room was on the first floor over looking the small square outside the East India Rooms with the, much photographed, fountain.On entering the room there is a lobby with table and chairs, sofa and mini bar and other drinks. Shuttered windows on either side of the door into the main room. In here is a massive double bed, wardrobes, desk and chair, pot plants, chaise-longue and all in the colonial pattern. The rooms are air-conditioned to take account of the humidity.The bathroom was large with two wash basins, large shower and a bath plus wc, etc.Outside the room on the shared veranda (as with many rooms in Raffles) with a table and chairs. We made use of these when he complimentary Champagne arrivedDue to the renovation Evening Meal was available in part of the Billiard Bar. This was not the same as the Raffles Grill but good choice of food and service was fine.

Some people just come and walk round, take photographs and leave, that's fine if it's all you want to do.

The decor feels like a mix between the 1920s and 1940s, but it's all tasteful and elegant. The rooms are all suites with 15 foot ceilings and hard dark wood floors. It's amazing to see what an establishment that started out 130 years ago turned into. It is currently in the first phase of a total renovation, the next phase begins December 13, 2017 and will last until August 2018. The last time it was renovated totally was in 1989. Oddly enough, we may have to come back to compare the before and after. It's a great location to everything--malls, sites and the mass transit system. One of my pet peeves are small wash clothes and not only do they have them but they are tied with a gold colored sash. The toiletries are ample size of of good quality. This is one of the most comfortable rooms I've stayed in, but I prefer the \"old romantic charm\" to the new modern \"glitz\". Don't forget to go to the Bar & Billiard Room to have a Singapore Sling in the bar where the drink was first created in 1915! If this post was helpful to you, please give me a helpful rating.

But we could still wander through some of the public rooms and although the Long Bar was closed we enjoyed our Singapore Sling in the Billiard and Bar room. The service was great and we chatted to other tourists during our visit.Not a cheap experience, but one that just has to be done! At the time of our visit with the exchange rate it worked out at around £42 for two drinks. This price includes local taxes and the service charge, which we kept forgetting were nearly always additional costs when eating and drinking anywhere in Singapore.Oh and we visited the shop and bought a Christmas bauble with Raffles Hotel on it. It looks great on our Christmas tree with flashing lights!\n",

      "It was a place for people from England and Australia really.Read your history if you doubt that.Bill Somerset Maugham set the tone and wrote a few books - and quite a few short stories here. It's sadly true that he didn't invent the Writers' Bar, but he is reputed to have spent a fair bit of time there, as you would expect.It is however quite likely true that Empire citizens only (Commonwealth after about 1954) were permitted.

The atmosphere in the bar was excellent and the service from the waiters, especially Marvin from the Philippines, made our visits extra special. A huge thank you to Marvin for being so attentive and helpful - you are the best!We’ll definitely go back for a Singapore Sling or two when we make our way back to this fabulous city and establishment.\n",

      "I have been waiting for this all my life and was not disappointed. This is iconic and a must do, but make sure you book and check what is going on at the hotel first. With renovations, mass parties and weddings, it can distract from your personal adventure and experience. That said, this is by far an amazing experience.\n",

      "One of the most famous luxury hotel in Singapore. A staff shared with me that Michael Jackson used to stay here too. Do try out the famous 'Singapore Sling' too! Great rowdy location. Perfect for night outs\n",

      "Cannot visit Singapore without indulging in the atmosphere of the Long Bar in Raffles Hotel, sipping several Singapore Slings. With the billiard room next door and the entrance enabling you to walk along the palm lined corridors and the 'courtyard' surrounded by the guest rooms, the ambiance is complete. It does remind one of 'days gone by' in a very pleasant and nostalgic way - a positive reminder of things that appear to be eternal. And another sling............please..............\n"
